        <p>
          At CRAFT Gabion, we believe in combining natural elements, attention to detail, and craftsmanship to deliver lasting structures that are both functional and beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re a small, independent team dedicated to quality over quantity. Every gabion we build reflects a deep respect for our materials, environment, and your vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          From our first sketch to final rock placement, we treat each project as if it were our own. That’s why our values—honesty, craftsmanship, and consistency—guide everything we do.
