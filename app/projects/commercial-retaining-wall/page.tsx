        <p>
          This large-scale gabion retaining wall was built to stabilize a sloped commercial site while meeting strict engineering specs. The wall needed to hold back over 6 feet of grade across a 60-foot span.
        </p>
        <p>
          We sourced heavy-duty mesh cages and used angular basalt rock to create optimal interlock and drainage. The wall also includes weep holes and buried filtration to manage water flow without erosion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Timing was critical on this job — we coordinated tightly with concrete crews, electricians, and landscapers to stay on track and avoid delays during site development.
        </p>
        <p>
          The finished wall is rock-solid, visually striking, and built to last. It’s a great example of how gabions can fulfill infrastructure needs while still delivering aesthetics.
