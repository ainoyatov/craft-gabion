          This gabion entryway was designed for a modern desert home with clean lines and natural finishes. The client wanted a structure that added architectural interest and blended with their xeriscaped surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>
          We selected a cool-toned stone mix to complement the home’s neutral stucco and metal features. The entryway also needed to provide a sense of privacy and security while remaining visually open — a perfect use case for gabion cages.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the main challenges was anchoring the structure securely without disrupting existing irrigation lines. We coordinated with the homeowner’s landscaper to ensure a smooth install that respected the original layout.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result is a sharp, welcoming focal point that feels rooted in the space. It adds dimension to the property without overwhelming it, proving that even small-scale gabion work can make a strong design statement.
