          This compact project was all about maximizing space in a tight urban yard. The client wanted to define their patio and garden zones without closing off light or airflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          We proposed a low-profile gabion divider, about waist-high, to separate the lounge area from raised beds and herbs. Recycled crushed stone was used for a lighter fill that still gave strong visual contrast against the surrounding greenery.

          Installation had to be done with minimal disruption to the existing garden — no heavy equipment, no regrading. The modular cage design made it possible to assemble and fill in place using hand tools and wheelbarrows.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result is functional but beautiful — a true example of how gabions can support urban spaces without sacrificing design or practicality.
