          This project combined the organic texture of gabions with the movement and sound of water. The homeowner envisioned a tranquil garden space where rock and water could interact in a visually striking way.

        <p>
          We constructed a vertical gabion wall fitted with a recirculating pump system. Water spills gently over a smooth center slab inset within the rock, creating a subtle and soothing effect.

          Careful waterproofing and drainage considerations were key. We included an access hatch hidden in the rear cage for maintenance, and the base was reinforced to handle the added weight of water flow and stone.

          The finished piece is now the centerpiece of their yard â€” functional, artistic, and deeply calming. It attracts birds, masks ambient noise, and brings a natural rhythm to the space.
